Introduction
============

This module adds a new command for the nginx configuration file: set_from_cookie

To use it: set_from_cookie CookieName $some_var; 

This will cause every reference to $some_var to return the value of the 
cookie called CookieName. 

I developed it to use in conjunction with the hash proxy module and my 
random module, to allow client stickeness from initial request until the 
client session ends. Here is a snippet of the configuration I'm using:

server {
    listen       80;

    server_name  www.my-host.com;


    set_random $random_num;
    set_from_cookie "morph_lb_id" $cookie_var;

    if ($cookie_var !~ ^\d+$) {
        set $morph_lb_id $random_num;
        set $morph_cookie "morph_lb_id=$morph_lb_id; $http_cookie";
        set $set_cookie_var "morph_lb_id=$morph_lb_id";
    }

    if ($cookie_var ~ ^\d+$) {
        set $morph_cookie $http_cookie;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_set_header Cookie $morph_cookie;
        add_header Set-Cookie $set_cookie_var;

        root   html;
        index  index.html index.htm;
        if (!-f $request_filename) {
            proxy_pass http://mongrel;
            break;
        }

    }
}



This configuration is used where nginx serves as both an incoming proxy and as a 
load balancer. The load balancer is in the upstream and will read the cookie
to load balance. But could also be user here, using the variable $morph_lb_id
as the key in the following upstream:


upstream my_app_servers {
    server app_1;
    server app_2;
    hash   $morph_lb_id;
}



Installation
============

Download the Nginx sources from http://nginx.net/ and unpack it.

To build Nginx, change to the directory which contains the Nginx
sources, and run the configuration script making sure to add the path
to the set-random sources using the --add-module option.

  $ ./configure --add-module=/path/to/mod-read-cookies


Build and install the software:

  $ make
  $ sudo make install
