Revision history of ngx_http_upstream_memcached_hash_module.

0.04  2009-02-07
        - bugfix release, also breaks Ketama mode compatibility with
        C::M::F 0.13 and below, upgrade C::M::F to at least 0.14.

        Change calculation of Ketama points for a given server to get
        mapping ratios closer to server weight ratios.  Ketama mode is
        compatible with Cache::Memcached::Fast 0.14, which has the
        same change, and is incompatible with earlier versions.

        Fix key distribution bug in compatible mode.  Because of
        rounding error some keys were mapped to wrong servers.  This
        bug is different from the one fixed in 0.3.

        Do not change callback and data pointers passed by nginx after
        module initialization.  This makes the module compatible with
        other intermediate "balancers" up the chain.  Such balancers
        do not perform actual balancing, but may process host address
        that we return, for instance map it to cached open connection.

        - bugfix release.

        Fix key distribution bug in compatible mode.  Because of
        accumulated rounding error some keys were mapped to the
        different server than with Cache::Memcached.


0.02  2008-02-19
        - add support for $memcached_namespace variable.

        If Cache::Memcached::Fast uses

           namespace => 'prefix',

        then nginx configuration file should have

          set $memcached_namespace "prefix";

        This is not the same as prepending "prefix" to $memcached_key:
        namespace prefix should not be hashed.


0.01  2008-01-27
        - first official release.

        The hashing is fully compatible with Cache::Memcached::Fast
        and Cache::Memcached, and thus with any other client that is
        compatible with C::M.


0.00  2007-12-24
        - development started.
